<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Architecture</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Compare and contrast the types of frontend
development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML,
JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In the course of completing our Travlr
full-stack application, the project evolved, from a static HTML website, to an
Express HTML website, and then an SPA application was added, using AngularJS.
All along the way, JavaScript was employed to provide functionality to the
website, sometimes in combination with Express HTML and sometimes in
combination with AngularJS. Additionally, TypeScript was used to implement the components
of the SPA.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Express HTML provided powerful tools to define
and configure routes and API endpoints. Handlebars was a very useful feature
for transforming templated HTML into real HTML (at runtime). It also enabled me
to share templates across pages, thereby facilitating reuse of effort (e.g.,
for the nav panel). JavaScript was an essential tool in the development of
controllers to serve the routes and API.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>AngularJS provided powerful component
defining tools. These components proved to be reusable and did an excellent job
at allowing me to separate concerns. AngularJS’s components acted as extension
elements in HTML documents, powerfully allowing me to insert these components
where needed in the HTML. The AngularJS components include TypeScript files
that bind a TypeScript class to the HTML extensions. TypeScript proved itself a
far more elegant tool for defining classes which are then automatically
translated into JavaScript by the compiler. AngularJS also enabled me to
incorporate security into the application.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB
database?</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This question has several answers. Using a
NoSQL MongoDB database was a requirement for the project. Our decision to develop
a MEAN stack application implicitly indicated that a NoSQL MongoDB database
would be our preferred database backend. As for the attributes of a MongoDB
database that make it an ideal DB for this application, I would include among
them the use of JSON which integrates nicely with JavaScript and TypeScript. In
terms of representation, Mongo’s use of JSON closely parallels our models.
Finally, our application did not require us to join documents across
collections. While Mongo DB allows joining, joining is more straightforward in
SQL DBs. Without the need for joins or complex joins, there was no reason to
consider an SQL DB.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Functionality</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>How is JSON different from Javascript and
how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>JSON is not a programming language. It is
a lightweight format for transmitting stored data. In this sense, JSON is much
like XML with the significant difference that its representation is based on JavaScript’s
syntax for literals (i.e., JS’s object, array, string, number, and boolean value
syntax). JSON ties together the frontend and the backend development pieces by
serializing JavaScript values into JSON strings and by deserializing JSON
strings into JavaScript values. Data transmitted from the frontend to the
backend is serialized as JSON and then deserialized by MongoDB into MongoDB
queries, directives, and documents. Likewise, MongoDB serializes result sets
and responses containing response information, collections, and documents into
JSON which, in turn, are deserialized by the frontend into JavaScript objects.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Provide instances in the full stack
process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and
name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The Card and CardList components are
excellent examples of refactoring. We began with static HTML which contained a
series of information about trips. Each trip contained an image, title, description,
and other content. A CardList component was developed to iteratively display
this information via Angular. The CardList itself was then refactored to reference
a Card component. The Card component contained the trip-specific information and
image. The CardList arranged these Cards into a list. The benefits of this
technique include reusability and separation of concerns. The display and
layout of a specific trip is handled by the Card. It has no need to know about
the context in which it is displayed. The display and layout of the list of
cards needs only to know that it is displaying cards but had no need to know
about the specifics of a Card. Both the Card and the CardList could be used by
other pages or even on the same page in a different context. For example, we
could have added a hover feature to Card images that would have overlayed more
details about the trip it describes and it could include another instance of
the Card itself in this overlay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Testing</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Methods for request and retrieval
necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the
difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your
understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Endpoints are API routes that used to
access the internal functionality of the application. Methods (i.e. put, get, post,
and delete) are used to qualify the access (i.e., create, retrieve, update, and
delete to the backend). Security wraps these calls to ensure that only those
with credentials to perform the operation are permitted to do so. Security
depends upon authentication – the secure process of confirming the identity of
the user and retrieving the user’s credentials.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Reflection</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>How has this course helped you in reaching
your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered
in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career
field?</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The skills I have learned and developed through
this course include a better understanding of HTML, proficiency in JavaScript
programming, a further development of my MongoDB skills, an introduction to
TypeScript, and an introduction to Angular. Beyond the specific tools, I have
learned through experience exactly what a full-stack application is, how the
different parts work together, and how to integrate the front-end of a web-application
with its backend. I have also learned more about the REST model in general, how
to structure a web application, and how to manage the plethora of parts that
work together as whole.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Since I aspire to become a developer, I
believe all of these skills are useful skills to carry in my toolbox of
experience. In the current market, knowledge of MEAN development is highly
desirable. Knowledge of full-stack development in general will also extend to
help me learn other full-stack suites.</span></p>
